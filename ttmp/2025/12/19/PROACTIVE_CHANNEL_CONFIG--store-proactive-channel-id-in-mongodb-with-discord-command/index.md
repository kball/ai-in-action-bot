# Store proactive channel ID in MongoDB with Discord command

## Overview

This ticket moves the proactive announcements channel ID from environment variable configuration to MongoDB storage, and adds a Discord slash command (`/set-proactive-channel`) to allow administrators to configure the channel directly from Discord.

**Current State**: Channel ID is stored in `PROACTIVE_ANNOUNCEMENTS_CHANNEL_ID` environment variable, requiring container restarts to change.

**Goal**: Store channel ID in MongoDB (`GuildSettings` model) and provide Discord command for runtime configuration without restarts.

**Status**: Design phase - see [design document](./design-doc/01-proactive-channel-configuration-via-mongodb-and-discord-command.md) for implementation plan.
