# Add Proactive Messages

## Overview

This ticket aims to add proactive messaging capabilities to the AI in Action Discord bot. Currently, the bot only responds to user messages and slash commands. We need to implement the ability for the bot to send messages proactively based on events, schedules, or other triggers.

**Current State Analysis**: A comprehensive analysis of the message sending architecture and runtime has been completed. See the [Message Sending and Runtime Architecture Analysis](./reference/01-message-sending-and-runtime-architecture-analysis.md) document for details on:
- How messages are currently sent (reply, thread creation, slash commands)
- Runtime architecture (Discord client + HTTP server)
- Event handling patterns
- State management
- LLM integration points

**Next Steps**: Design proactive messaging patterns that integrate with the existing architecture.
